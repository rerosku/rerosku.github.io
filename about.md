**Alex** (aka **Rerosku**) is a tech lover always looking for some new challenges.

The latest is Jekyll and a static blog wit GitHub.. challenging!

I like to find solutions to everyday's problems and write articles about it so that other won't go through the struggle of figuring it out by themselves.

Follow me and I'll show you that you don't ALWAYS need something just because it's a trend. There are many better alternatives!
